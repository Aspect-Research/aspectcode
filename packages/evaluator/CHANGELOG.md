# @aspectcode/evaluator

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/asashepard/aspectcode/pull/16) [`cdb5511`](https://github.com/asashepard/aspectcode/commit/cdb5511bfc29977db995bbc07b0a7ce54cf961d2) Thanks [@asashepard](https://github.com/asashepard)! - Add evidence-based evaluation to the optimization pipeline

  - New `@aspectcode/evaluator` package: harvests real prompts from local AI tool logs (Claude Code, Cline, Aider, VS Code Copilot), runs probe-based micro-tests against generated KB content, and diagnoses failures with targeted fixes
  - Optimizer now accepts evaluator feedback to self-correct instructions across iterations
  - CLI dashboard overhauled: terminal clears before launch, setup notes show config/API key/tool status, evaluator progress displays harvest counts, probe pass rates, and diagnosis fixes in real time with a live elapsed timer; complaint input hidden during active work phases
  - CI workflows updated to build and test the evaluator package in dependency order

- Updated dependencies [[`cdb5511`](https://github.com/asashepard/aspectcode/commit/cdb5511bfc29977db995bbc07b0a7ce54cf961d2)]:
  - @aspectcode/optimizer@0.3.4
